              they apply for and accept and how and when they fulfil their
              contractual obligations with a Business in compliance with these
              Terms. Attender is not an employment or a labour hire agency.
              Attender reserves the right to ban any Business from its platform

              contract plus Attender`s Service Fee must be made by the Business
              by credit card in advance to the Attender escrow service account.

            <p>
              Upon completion of the contract, payment will be held for 2
              working days before being released to the relevant Attendant.
              Should a Business wish to dispute a payment before being released
              to an Attendant it must do so within 24 hours of the event or
              matter giving rise to such wish using the Payment Dispute
              mechanism on the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Attender will provide a tax invoice to the Business for our fees

              If a Business cancels an agreed contract within 24 hours of the
              agreed commencement time of the fulfillment of the contract, a
              cancellation fee of $50 will be deducted from the Business`s
              escrow payment before the balance of the payment is returned to
              the Business.

          </li>
          <li>
            Cancellation of a Contract after Commencement
            <p>
              If a Business no longer requires an Attendant after commencement
              of the contract or part way through fulfilment of a contract, then
              payment for the contract will be made in full. However, should the
              Attendant fail to fulfil their obligations under the contract
              (e.g. fail to turn up or on their own volition depart prior to
              completion of the contract), the Business may lodge a Payment
              Dispute flag and upon determination may receive a full or partial
              refund. Payment Disputes must be registered with Attender within
              24 hours of the event or matter giving rise to such.
